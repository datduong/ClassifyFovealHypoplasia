## Instruction 

Because our Foveal Hypoplasia dataset is small, we need to borrow the power of a larger auxilary dataset. You must download [this dataset](https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/rscbjbr9sj/3) which contains about 100k images ([their paper](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29474911/)).

We trained our own EfficientNetB4 on these 100k images ([script]()).
